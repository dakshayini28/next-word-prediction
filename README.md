# next-word-prediction
This project will involve creating a next word prediction model using Deep Learning with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and a user interface built with Streamlit. The Sherlock_Holmes_Adventure_Set  dataset, which contains a wide variety of text, will be used to train the model. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can predict the next word in a sentence, making it useful for applications like text prediction and content generation. The data will be prepared through processes like tokenization, padding to ensure that the model can effectively learn from the dataset. The LSTM model will then be trained on this processed data, learning patterns and relationships between words to make accurate predictions. Once the model is trained, it will be integrated into a Streamlit-based user interface. This interface will allow users to input text and see the modelâ€™s predictions in real-time. By the end of the project, a fully functional next word prediction tool will be developed, demonstrating the capabilities of deep learning in natural language processing.
